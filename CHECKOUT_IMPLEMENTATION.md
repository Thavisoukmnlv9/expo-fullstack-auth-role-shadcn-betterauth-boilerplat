# Checkout System Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the checkout and ticket system for TripBuddy.

## Overview

The checkout system consists of three main pages:

1. **Choose Payment** (`/checkout/:orderId/payment`)
2. **QR Payment** (`/checkout/:orderId/payment/qr`)
3. **Ticket Detail** (`/tickets/:ticketId`)

## Features Implemented

### 1. Choose Payment Page
- ✅ Header with "Choose Payment Method"
- ✅ Order summary card with countdown timer
- ✅ Total amount display with currency conversion
- ✅ Purchaser email display
- ✅ Payment method cards (LAO QR, Membership Card, Bank/Wallet/Phone)
- ✅ Order expiration handling with regenerate button
- ✅ Navigation to QR payment screen

### 2. QR Payment Page
- ✅ Ticket-shaped QR card with yellow frame
- ✅ QR code generation (using react-native-qrcode-svg)
- ✅ Bill details (Bill number, Buy time, Total amount, Discount)
- ✅ Warning panel with 1-minute countdown
- ✅ Save QR code functionality
- ✅ Payment status polling (every 2 seconds)
- ✅ Automatic redirect to ticket detail on success
- ✅ QR regeneration on expiration

### 3. Ticket Detail Page
- ✅ Header with package name, tier, and share button
- ✅ Large QR code display
- ✅ Validity panel (status, activatedAt, expiresAt, relative validity)
- ✅ Entitlements table (place name, allowed/remaining visits, cooldown)
- ✅ Usage history (last 10 redemptions)
- ✅ Help & actions section (Where to scan, Transfer, Add to wallet)

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
- `react-native-qrcode-svg` - For QR code generation

### Type Definitions
- `src/types/checkout.ts` - Order, PaymentIntent, Ticket types
- `src/mocks/checkout.ts` - Mock data for testing

### Navigation
- Updated client layout to include new routes
- Integrated with existing package detail page
- Updated tickets page to navigate to individual ticket details

### Mock API Integration
- All API calls are currently mocked with realistic delays
- Ready for real API integration by replacing mock calls with actual fetcher calls

## File Structure

```
app/(protected)/(client)/
├── checkout/
│   └── [orderId]/
│       └── payment/
│           ├── index.tsx          # Choose Payment page
│           └── qr/
│               └── index.tsx      # QR Payment page
└── tickets/
    └── [ticketId]/
        └── index.tsx              # Ticket Detail page

src/
├── types/
│   └── checkout.ts                # Type definitions
└── mocks/
    └── checkout.ts                # Mock data
```

## Testing the Flow

1. Navigate to a package detail page
2. Click "Book Now" to create an order
3. Choose "LAO QR Payment" method
4. View QR code and wait for payment simulation
5. After successful payment, view ticket details

## Next Steps

1. Replace mock API calls with real API endpoints
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add loading states and better UX
4. Implement actual payment processing
5. Add ticket transfer and wallet functionality
6. Implement proper authentication and user session management

## Notes

- All timers and countdowns are functional
- QR codes are generated from mock payload data
- Payment polling simulates real payment processing
- The system is ready for production API integration
